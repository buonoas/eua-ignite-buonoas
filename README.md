### Observed differences:
| Visual Studio | Command Line |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Visual cues/prompts, may aid in workflow | No visual references, reliant on command familiarity |
| Additional tools (Commit Graph, list view, extensions) | Straightforward |

### Preferences:
- Prefer command line
- More exposure & familiarity
- More convenient to execute all commands from one place versus having to click around the Source Control panel

### Situational advantages between the two methods:
- Can definitely see Visual Studio being more useful in cases where there are merge conflicts or big disparities between main and a local branch
- VS is more convenient when working with a large code base; having access to all branches at a glance to get an idea of what changes were made where in a way that's more efficient
